== Steps of how to become a 5argon! ==
- Clone to your home folder
- Symlink .vimrc inside ~/.vim to your home folder so vim can read it
`ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
- The plugins are not there (yet) so go into ~/.vim and
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
- Symlink the .bash_profile too!
- Now install Powerline font by running the .sh file in the font folder.
- If on linux the .gconf can change Terminal's color.
- Complete!
